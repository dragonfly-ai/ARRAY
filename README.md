# NArr
Pronounced: <i>(ˈnär, as in gnarly)</i>.<br />
Stands for: <i>Native Array</i><br />
Definition: A fully cross compiled Scala Array library to optimally unify native array types across all compilation targets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Scala Native and Scala JVM share a unified Array type, Scala.js presents no fewer than 14: `scala.Array`, `js.Array`, `Int8Array`, `Uint8Array`, `Uint8ClampedArray`, `Int16Array`, `Uint16Array`, `Int32Array`, `Uint32Array`, `Float16Array`, `Float32Array`, `Float64Array`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At its core, NArr provides the `narr.NArray[T]` type which, as a drop in replacement for `scala.Array[T]` and `js.Array[T]`, always reduces to the most optimized native array type available on the compilation target platform.  `NArray[T]` also provides seamless interoperability with native array types without any platform specific code.

<b>Advantages</b>:<br />
<ul>
<li>Performance!<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Scala.js cross projects use the `NArray` type internally they implicitly take advantage of each platform's most optimized data structures.  While JVM Arrays inherit the speed and compactness of C/C++ style Arrays, JavaScript Arrays are a special case of JavaScript's Object type: the only data structure it has.  Likewise, making use of native `Array` types eliminates all performance penalties associated with conversions and wrappers at the boundary between a Scala.js library and native code that makes use of it.</li>
<li>Native Interoperability without Boilerplate<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;When writing a cross compiled Scala.js library with accessibility from native languages, developers have to pay attention to `@JSExport` annotations and make sure that every method or field of type Array has an analogous `js.Array` exposed in the JavaScript build.  By simply replacing all references to `js.Array` or `Array` with `NArray`, the same methods and fields will interoperate seamlessly with code in either run time environment.</li>
</ul>

<b>Caveats</b>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the `TypedArray` family of data structures avoids the following issues, they pertain to the more ubiquitous `js.Array`.
<ul>
<li>Type Safety Concerns.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the JVM `Array` has a reference to the type of its elements and the JavaScript `Array` has no concept of type at all, careless or malicious JavaScript developers could spike a js.Array with unexpected or dangerous values before passing it to an unsuspecting Scala.js method that takes parameters of type `NArray[T]`.  Security concerns aside, if abused, these type system distinctions could cause unwanted run time differences between the behavior of JVM and JavaScript versions of a program.  However, using `js.Array[T]` explicitly doesn't solve these issues, either.  These concerns argue against `js.Array` in general as much as they argue against `NArray`.
</li>
<li>Size Inconsistency and Mutability Concerns.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JVM `Array` has a fixed, immutable length while the length of a JavaScript `Array` can change dynamically.  To mitigate the usual dangers of shared mutable state, users of NArr had better treat all instances of `NArray` like JVM arrays, ideally by restricting all interaction with instances of `NArray[T]` to only three operations:<br />

```scala
// assume: val a:NArray[String]

a(0)              // read element
a(0) = "Gnarly!"  // write element
a.length          // read length
```
</li>
<li>

Output from `toString()` differs by platform.  For example:

```scala
println(new NArray[Int](3))
```

yields different results depending on the platform on which it runs.
<ul>
<li>

Scala.js prints the contents of the array: `0,0,0`

</li>
<li>

On the JVM, it prints something like: `[I@176c3251`

</li>
<li>

In Scala Native, it prints something like: `scala.scalanative.runtime.IntArray@24da9104`

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>

In Scala.js, accessing an index of newly allocated Array yields: `undefined` and, on the JVM and Native, yields `null`.

</li>
<li>

Sorting in JavaScript environments.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every native JavaScript array type has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort">builtin `sort(compareFn)` method</a> where `compareFn` indicates an optional comparison lambda.  For the `TypedArray` family, default sorting behaves like default sorting in Scala, however, the default behavior of `js.Array[T <: AnyRef]` sorts its elements alphabetically by their `toString()` representations.  From Scala development perspectives, we almost never want that, so NArr provides extension methods that connect Scala `Ordering[T]` objects to native JavaScript sorting methods.  In general, you can assure consistent sorting behavior across platforms by explicitly providing the desired sort order.  The most illuminating example comes from trying to sort `NArray[Long]`:

```scala
// Sorting a NArray[Long]:
val sla: NArray[Long] = NArray[Long](555L, 4444L, 9L, 11111L, 88L)
sla.sort() // default JavaScript sorting calls toString() on each element.
// yields: NArray[Long](11111, 4444, 555, 88, 9) sorted in alphabetical order.  :(
sla.sort(Ordering.Long) // Better pass the ordering explicitly!
// yields: NArray[Long](9, 88, 555, 4444, 11111) sorted in numerically ascending order.  :)
```

</li>
</ul>

NArr has no impact on JVM or Native performance, but it can dramatically speed up JavaScript by making use of natively optimized data structures and eliminating conversions that tend to have `O(n)` run time complexities.  It also adds convenience methods for `js.Array[T]` such as `fill` and `tabulate`, but mainly eliminates the need for specially crafted and maintained `@JSExport` methods and fields for JavaScript interop.

To use this library with SBT:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "ai.dragonfly" %%% "NArr" % "<LATEST_VERSION>"
```

How to use NArr:

```scala
import NArray

// constructor call
val a1:NArray[String] = new NArray[String](5)  // in JavaScript this resolves to js.Array[String]

// literal
val a2:NArray[Int] = NArray[Int](2, 4, 8, 16)  // in JavaScript this resolves to Int32Array

// fill
val a3:NArray[Double] = NArray.fill[Double](10)(42)  // in JavaScript this resolves to Float64Array

// tabulate
val a4:NArray[Double] = NArray.tabulate[Double](42)(
  (i:Int) => i * Math.random()
)

// multi dimensional
val a2d:NArray[NArray[Double]] = NArray[NArray[Double]](
  NArray.tabulate[Double](5)( (i:Int) => i * Math.random() ),
  NArray.tabulate[Double](5)( (i:Int) => i * Math.random() ),
  NArray.tabulate[Double](5)( (i:Int) => i * Math.random() ),
  NArray.tabulate[Double](5)( (i:Int) => i * Math.random() )
) // in JavaScript this resolves to js.Array[Float64Array]

// enjoy Scala semantics
a2d.foreach((d:Double) => println(d))

// conveniently expose Scala.js libraries to native JavaScript and Java developers without any need for wrappers or conversions.
@JSExportTopLevel("copy")
def copy(a0:NArray[Double]): NArray[Double] = NArray.tabulate[Double](a0.length)(
  (i:Int) => a0(i)
)

## Gotcha

You may see this error, when working with higher kinded types, for example a hypothetical `Matrix[A]` and narr.

```scala
Matrix(
    NArray(1.0, 3.0, 2.0),
    (3, 1)
)
```

```scala
Error: [137] [error] 37 |      Matrix(
Error: [137] [error]    |      ^^^^^^
Error: [137] [error]    |None of the overloaded alternatives of method apply in object Matrix with types
Error: [137] [error]    | [A]
```
In fact, the constructor is quite valid.

It seems that sometimes, the compiler needs a little help when working with generics - in this example a `Matrix[A]`. Providng the type hints, should resolve the issue.

```scala
Matrix[Double](
    NArray[Double](1.0, 3.0, 2.0),
    (3, 1)
)
```
